# Getting started
Have to install selenium (python package) for the current twitterscraper. I did
it via `pip install selenium`. You need python 3 tho.

The address parser currently is `pip install usaddress` which I got from here: 
https://github.com/datamade/usaddress.

Lastly, you will need to download the chrome browser as well as the chrome 
driver, and then put the chrome driver in your PATH that python looks in.

## TODO:
### Current Goals
- [ ] Figure out how to parse addresses appropriately
- [ ] Figure out how to parse dates/times appropriately

### Future Goals
- [ ] Create a twitter scraper class with useful functions
- [ ] Make a list of food trucks to test on


## Food trucks considered only in LA
Kogi, NoMad, ...
